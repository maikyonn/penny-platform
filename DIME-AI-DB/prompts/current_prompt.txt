Analyze the provided Instagram bio, each caption/location pair, and the aggregated post locations to assign four scores, determine demographics, and generate 10 unique keywords as described below. Treat any location explicitly mentioned in the biography as the strongest evidence of the creator’s home base. Reason carefully from the bio, content themes, and geographic signals. Post locations may reflect travel; only infer a probable home area from them when many posts cite the same region.
